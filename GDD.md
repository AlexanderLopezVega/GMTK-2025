# Theme
**Loop**

# Idea
- You control a player with WASD to move around.
- Press `Space` to enable hook, now control hook with WASD
- If you complete a loop with the hook, certain things happen:
	- If there is a collectable, bring the collectable to you
	- If there is a grapple point, move to the grapple point
	- If there is an enemy, bring the enemy to you
- If you hit an enemy with the hook, you deal damage
- Move between 2+ trains in movement
- Trains end in portals and reappear in the other end
	- A new wagon is added in each loop
- Objective: survive
